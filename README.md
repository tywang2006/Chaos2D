I am working in Ashgaming, a playtech company but it is my personal private project. It is nothing to do with my company so please don't ask any question on my job. Thanks for your corporation.

I won't update the version until i got another big project done. Then I will build a better 2D version for this engine. I can't tell what it is. However, once you see that, that must blow your mind. just keep claim.
